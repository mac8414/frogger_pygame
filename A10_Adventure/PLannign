# Changes Made on 12/6
---Added levels switching when frogger reaches end. Just hit space bar
---Change pygame.image.smoothscale and took it out, so that we can add images that have transparency, using make
------map function. I don't think we need the pygam.image.smoothscale because we have our images perfectly tailored
------to our window.







4- Add frogger movement with logs
5- Documentation


Not code:
- Make text file explaining game
- Make video showing off and explaining game
