Game Name: Frogger?!
By Charbel Salloum and Mckay Hunter


The theme of the game is based on a preexisting game called FROGGER. The goal i to get the FROGGER across 4 different dimensions (4 levels).
All levels have the same objective of getting the FROGGER to the other side, but each level has its own challenges.

Level 1: go through the maze of rocks, with the goal of reaching the end. And there is only one way to reach the end although it looks like there are more!

Level 2: try to reach the end avoiding the moving cars. If the FROGGER gets hit, you lose the game.

Level 3: try to reach the end by again dodging the cars, and crossing the lava by hopping on moving logs

Level 4: just like level 3, just FASTER!



Hours spent making the game: 35 hours


Successes: It felt very rewarding to complete every part of this game.
We found it easy to get objects to go through the create, update, and draw cycle once we got it done for the frogger.
We encountered many challenges that we eventually overcame and found answers to, which was very rewarding.

Challenges: It was hard to make some aspects work without any help.
For example, we struggled to get the FROGGER movement to work in a way so it FROGGER canâ€™t move diagonally and hops instead of walks.
Also, it was a struggle to understand how to make and spawn in all cars without doing it individually.
We had similar struggles with the Object collision of the logs.



Pros of working with a partner: Having different perspectives to overcome challenges and create more efficient code.

Cons of working with a partner: Trying to align schedules to work together.

What we can do better for the future is plan out all the days we are free and create a chart of what we will work on
for those days and see where we might need extra help to go to TA hours.
